# Cryptocurrencies
Overview: The purpose of the project is to use unsupervised learning to process data, cluster and the dimensions and the principal component using PCA. We are also instructed to create a report that included the traded cryptocurrencies classified according to their features. We also instructed to process the database, the data dimension by using the Principal Component Analysis. Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means. Finally, to visualize the results with 2D and 3D to draw scatter plots.
Results:
After processing and clearing the data, we are able to come up with 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.

We use the unsupervised learning machine to find the best value for K-Means by using the Elbow Curve. The best K value appears to be 4 on the Elbow curve graph.

The Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results 3-D scatter plot was obtained by using the PCA algorithm that help reduce the cryptocurrencies dimension to the principal components

Based on similarities and the features, we were able to identify the classification of 532 cryptocurrencies. 
Summary: In conclusion we are able to identify 532 cryptocurrencies that have some similarities and features. More analyze need to conduct on each of the group to determine their performance and potential interest for the investment of the bank clients
